What makes React wonderful is not only the core library itself but the ecosystem around. Indeed, the ecosystem around it is as much a reason to learn React as React itself.</p>\n<p>The modules following this one are considered to be optional modules: you don't need to know all of these; I'd say just pick the ones you need for your project or what interests you the most and leave the others behind. For the most part these modules will be self-contained: you don't need to complete all the optional modules to understand what's going on. Some <em>will</em> use the code you built in the previous modules here but feel free to clone the complete project and work from there.</p>\n<p>Good job getting this far and good luck on the next modules!</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/conclusion","title":"Conclusion","order":12}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":1,"path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":2,"path":"/pure-react","title":"Pure React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":3,"path":"/eslint-prettier","title":"npm, ESLint & Prettier"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":4,"path":"/parcel","title":"Parcel"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":5,"path":"/jsx","title":"JSX"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":6,"path":"/react-state-and-lifecycles","title":"State and Lifecycle Methods with React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":7,"path":"/reach-router","title":"Reach Router"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":8,"path":"/async-and-events-in-react","title":"Handling Events and Async UIs with React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":9,"path":"/forms","title":"Forms with React"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":10,"path":"/context","title":"Context"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":11,"path":"/portals","title":"Portals"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":12,"path":"/conclusion","title":"Conclusion"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":13,"path":"/testing","title":"Testing"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":14,"path":"/emotion","title":"Emotion"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":15,"path":"/code-splitting","title":"Code Splitting"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":16,"path":"/redux","title":"Redux"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":17,"path":"/server-side-rendering","title":"Server Side Rendering"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":18,"path":"/preact","title":"Preact"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":19,"path":"/code-organization","title":"Code Organization"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":20,"path":"/typescript","title":"TypeScript"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
